Brad ask his girlfriend  Angelina to take a good picture of himself. 
Angelina took Brad's iPhone and trying to have a great posture.
When she clicked "Capture" button, instead of it's taking a picture of Brad but scary
women's picture displayed. 

And here is Keypoint. 
It is not just scaring you but actually taking a photo of you by flipping the camera device!

Now it is implemented with scary pictures but it can be different kinds 
of pictures such as a cute dogs or one's passed away mother.
What would their face emotion be when they saw those images suddenly?
